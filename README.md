# Number Seven

Twitch overlay app build using Rails 7.  Personal project, not for general consumption.

## Setup

Install Rails 7, `bundle install` in the local directory.  Requires Redis.

Copy `.env-sample` to `.env` and fill out the required Twitch credentials. 

## TODO

  - Dockerize
  - Use Comfy.js to read chat from Twitch chat for the logged in user.
  - Use Turbo to load chat in real time to overlay screen.
